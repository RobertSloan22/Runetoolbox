I wonder if that script ever hits errors because I'm running other sqls
that we don't see
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 8:30 PM

that is two different tools i had to check the status of the sql query code that is included here after i corrected it, i also had a weird error but thought it was related to something i did, basically had chat gpt debug it with me and correct the code. so the corrected code is on the bottom there under the error log from a the first run .

Do we  look good on this what the fuck is with the error on the bottm
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 8:56 PM
nice, yeah bro we gotttttta put all this code into github repos too so we're not copy/pasting it and always both have easy access to the latest code that's running in production. Trust me it'll make us both work faster together another one of those things that's a few minutes invested now saves us hours later
bc like for example, it should be set up so that when our github code is pushed, into the repo.. that the hosted jobs are re-deployed
best way to manage open source
fullstacktacodev
 started a call that lasted a few seconds.
 ‚Äî Today at 8:58 PM
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 8:58 PM
like in fact, that's better than me needing access to the code running in the server
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 8:59 PM
Sorry I accidentally called just then
Yes üëç
All code goes in github starting now, my apologies I forgot completely about that
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 8:59 PM
ur good bro
ur doing a lot and they aren't small things
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:00 PM
Had a lot of domain jumping around
Yeah
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:00 PM
I just think a lot of these small little organization things will help u be more dynamic and flexible to bounce everywhere and again when I can help with stuff too and we share our skills it's unstoppable
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:01 PM
Agreed in full.
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:01 PM
did I ever mention I wish there were 45 hours in the day?? 
lol
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:05 PM
Il start tonight with adding code up to github. I am still going to get you full file system access. I did a lot of research on the Linux os, and I have all my stuff in my home directory, which is unaccessable to other users, so I‚Äôm going to move stuff to a shared directory that sits closer to the root of the system , I tried this but I made the shared directory inside my home directory and that does not work. Linux you have /root/users/Robert or ryan or who ever/ home. So il put it all in /root/shared/ and we will be good
I know that‚Äôs a fun read..
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:05 PM
but yeah bro I don't need access to any files
if u have it all in github
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
Bitcoin
Node
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
oh
yeah
hmm
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
It‚Äôs not a big deal
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
no
not rn
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
It‚Äôs several lines of code
To move stuff
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
also that's lower priority
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
So it‚Äôs fine
Ok
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
bitcoin node will be after data stuff
bitcoin is when we need to actually automate the transactions
and trading
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:06 PM
I just literally got that insight yesterday
Ok
Forsure. Tomorrow let‚Äôs task prioritize
I will put code to GitHub
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:07 PM
oh reread this lol well if it's not a crazy task then yeah it's nice to have for sure, but if u get stuck in a rabbit hole skip it
yeupp sounds good ser
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:08 PM
Cool, no I just poped out the other side of the rabbit hole lol been through it and back out again
So no digging needed
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 9:08 PM
lol good
I get stuck in em sometimes
a lot of the work we do requires rabbit holes ha
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:09 PM
I think it‚Äôs one big rabbit hole
With nodes of smaller rabbit holes tangled
Like Christmas lights
Lol.. ok so we‚Äôre good on the splitting part of that process correct ? With the runes? Did you see the pic I sent. I‚Äôm about to check magic Eden now
Yep we‚Äôre good
Image
so list and sell the two 5000 ones
Image
listed
I do need to ask, maybe tomorrow you can add some clarification, in the video you sent, you were eager to buy the bobmarley runes, when they were nearly minted out. Is that normally when you want to buy?
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 9:16 PM
So, would it be better to not jump in on runes if they are in the lower quartile of the minting process or even the first half?

fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 10:08 PM
Dude I have access to the server terminal via my cell phone in this video I check the sql data status
Cubs ‚Äî Today at 10:12 PM
ok now that's sick as fuck!
fullstacktacodev ‚Äî Today at 10:12 PM
I know right .... pretty fuckijng dope i was geekijng out hard a few min ago
